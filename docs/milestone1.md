# Data Interactions: 
The general purpose of our project is to efficiently help UMass students to find their lost items in real-time. We want to find a more convenient way of reporting lost or handing in found items. Therefore, we will use an application called "Google Maps" or other map resources for people to check the nearest lost and found station, so they can hand in anything that they find on campus. After people report their lost items and put pieces of information on our application, we will match their data with existing items under the "lost" label to check if someone found it already. Thus, to build the communication with different people, we might use social platforms such as "Instagram" or "Twitter", or even "iMessage" by phone number. 

In our application, we will have at least four different sources of data: post, reply, images, and map data. For the "post", users of our application are able to create a post with information that the item they found or lost. For the "reply", users of our application are able to reply to a post such as "I also saw this item at xx time xx location". For "images", users are able to upload images to specify the details of their lost or found items. For "map", users who lost something will get notified on the map once other users found items that match your description or reply to your post with location information.
